-  Hello, I am Chris. I love to code and work on new projects in my free time. 
-  I am interested in Software Engineering roles in Southern California as well as the West Coast. I am interested in working on new and exciting projects and learning new things. My core programming languages are C++ and C#. I have been programming in C++ and C# for close to three years. In my last job I spent most of my time programming in C++ and C# for game development projects that were created in C# and C++. However, I also did some programming in javaScript as well. 
- I am currently learning Python, AWS, and I am currently studying for my COMPTIA A+ and Network + certifications as well as improving my C++ and C# skills. 
- I am looking to collaborate on open source projects, startup opportunities, or passion projects.
