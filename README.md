-   Hello, my name is Chris. I love to code and work on new projects in my free time.  I am interested in Software Engineering roles in Southern California as well as the West Coast and Texas as well as Remote positions. I am interested in working on new and exciting projects and learning new things. My core programming languages are C++ and C# and Python. I have been programming in these languages for close to three years.  
- 👨‍💻 I am also currently learning, AWS, JavaScript and working on projects involving MicroServices.
- 👨‍💻 I am looking to collaborate on open source projects, startup opportunities, or passion projects. 
- 🚀 I am currently practicing my Data Structures and Algorithm skills on Leetcode.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at cmagnuson0489@gmail.com
- Remote work is probably one of the top things that I look for in a company.
